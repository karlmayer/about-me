Hi, I'm Karl. I guide and shape IT architecture at [Eli Lilly](http://lilly.com/). Aspiring to follow the blogging footsteps of tech influencers [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/), [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) and others, I thought I'd start my own.

I focus on digital strategy, effective communication, innovation, and mentoring through a _'architecture, architects, and architecting'_ lens. In addition, I find time daily to stay hands-on-keyboard and up-to-date on tech and innovation news, which I look forward to covering here.

I also promote and enjoy discussing [agile architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_architecture):

* Design emerges. Architecture is a collaboration.
* Communicate! The bigger the system, the longer the runway.
* Less is more. Simplicity is a force to apply.
* Embrace change: plan it, manage it.
* When in doubt, code or model it out.
* There is no monopoly on innovation.

I delight in being _'technology promiscuous'_ and jump between Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and OSS as needed &mdash; it's not as seedy as it sounds. I'm on life-long journey to do the same with programming that began (a long time ago) on an IBM XT & BASIC! Currently, I'm learning Erlang functional programming and digging into machine learning.

Outside work, I treasure time spent with my wonderful spouse and three exuberant sons. My many hobbies include reading, hiking, and handy work. My favorite past time is tabletop gaming â€” the creativity hooked me decades ago, but the camaraderie keeps me coming back.  

I hope you find future posts interesting, and I welcome you to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl--mayer/) or by email.
